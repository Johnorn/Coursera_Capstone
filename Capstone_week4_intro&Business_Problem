Sweet tooth locations

A new bakery chain called sweet tooth wants to plant one location in every borough of New York City. 
They are looking for locations that are far from any other bakeries. 
They are also looking for locations that are close to tourist attractions since sweets and locations always go together.

The data that would be used are venue locations provided by the foursquare API. 
We will use the API to find an ideal location with in a radius of 700 meters to a popular location in the borough. 
After finding the radius that we want, we will search for bakeries in that location. 
We will us these locations as hotspots for where not to be and plant the location that has the highest distance away from the nears bakery.
